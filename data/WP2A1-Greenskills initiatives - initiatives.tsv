UL	SENSE		Se saisir des enjeux des enjeux sociétaux et environnementaux /  Understanding the issues concerning society and the environment.	The SENSE certificate provides training in skills related to the major environmental and societal challenges of our time. These include energy, climate and biodiversity issues, as well as Equality, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI). The systemic nature of environmental and societal problems will be highlighted. This module will also propose possible actions as a student, citizen and future professional.   SENSE will comprise a first part in 1st year (6 hours of asynchronous distance learning), followed by a second part in 2nd year (24 hours of asynchronous distance learning), with different modules validated via e-learning activities. The aim of the course is to provide students with structured academic knowledge of these issues, and to help them define their academic career path and future career choices. 		https://formations.univ-lorraine.fr/fr/blog/sense-le-module-pour-comprendre-les-enjeux-societaux-et-environnementaux-n46 	https://factuel.univ-lorraine.fr/sites/factuel.univ-lorraine.fr/files/files/2024/u31850/fiche_certificat_sense.pdf 	https://factuel.univ-lorraine.fr/node/26160	1st and 2d year university students.	 - Course (1st year): 6h    - Course (2d year.semester1): 12h    - Course (2d year.semester2): 12h  	Energy, Sustainability and Sustainable development, Environmental Education and Awareness, Climate, Biodiversity.		online platform	 - Introduction to energy, climate and social issues; Introduction to the challenges of equality, diversity and inclusion (6h)   - Training in fundamental knowledge of climate change and biodiversity, based on the ABCs of Climate and Biodiversity; Complex systems and systems thinking (12h)   - Complex systems and systems thinking (2); Needs, values and responsibilities; In-depth study of Equality, Diversity and Inclusion; Controversies and narratives in the Anthropocene; Towards sustainable development?

NTUA	ΕΝ ΒΙΩ ΕΜΠ		ΕΝ ΒΙΩ ΕΜΠ (EN VIO NTUA): NTUA’s Roadmap to Energy Management & Sustainable Development is designed as a project of measurable outcomes to promote our vision for a sustainable future. 	Sustainable Development is typically defined as the intersection of three fields – environmental protection, social welfare and economic development – and can be best interpreted in a long-term perspective. Investing in sound energy management and sustainable development practices equals investing in the future, and constitutes an effective business strategy in view of expected energy and water cost savings, increased productivity, and related business resilience. Following the initiatives of NTUA’s Rector A. Boudouvis and Vice Rector I. Chatjigeorgiou, also Chair of the Senate Committee for Energy Management and Sustainable Development, a Roadmap to Energy Management and Sustainable Development has been compiled to promote sound energy management and sustainability practices as well as to align the efforts of the numerous respective groups and stakeholders across NTUA campuses.   By means of NTUA’s Roadmap to Energy Management and Sustainable Development, the Senate Committee for Energy Management and Sustainable Development develops strategies to promote sustainable practices on campus and aims at correlating the three pillars in the Roadmap: Environmental Protection, Education & Research, Community & Culture.   The Committee has compiled NTUA’s Roadmap to Energy Management and Sustainable Development to effectively correlate the roadmap to the goals established in NTUA’s strategic plan while incorporating proposals and suggestions of multiple university clusters including the student, faculty and staff communities. In effect, the Committee has identified five impact areas for each of the Roadmap pillars.		http://envio.ntua.gr/v1/en/home-english/ 		http://envio.ntua.gr/v1/en/roadmap-to-sustainability/pillars-impact-areas/research-education/ 	University staff, professors, students, researchers		Energy, Sustainability and Sustainable development, Environmental Education and Awareness, Climate.

Research and innovation (actions):   - Increasing the number of patents, licenses and start-ups (for-profit and not-for-profit) in the field of sustainable development.   - Identifying innovative approaches in vital areas and enabling a mechanism to enable students, academics and other staff to promote ideas that will have a positive impact.   - Utilization of NTUA facilities and spaces as a "living/dynamic laboratory" for academics and students to apply new ideas and study the results over time.   - Providing opportunities and incentives to enhance interdisciplinary research as well as interaction between academic and administrative services – fostering an environment of information exchange and collaboration.   - Securing external funding for endowed chairs aimed at supporting academics with research experience in sustainable development issues.   Global cooperation (Actions):    - Increasing the number of projects with an international composition to provide services in areas of sustainable development.   - Monitor opportunities for international students regarding services and study programs in sustainability issues.   - Searching for NTUA graduates leading sustainability initiatives at national and international level and connecting them with academic staff and students.   - Promotion of sustainable development issues in industry and at scientific conferences in order for the positive impact of NTUA actions to reach a larger audience. 			A variety of actions relevant to teaching, research, sustainable practices, reduction of energy use, etc. in the NTUA campus.					NTUA’s Senate Committee for Energy Management & Sustainability has undertaken a vital role in meeting specific needs for energy management and sustainable design for both the built and the natural environment of the campuses of the National Technical University of Athens (Patission Complex, Zografou Campus, Lavrion Technological and Cultural Park, Metsovion Interdisciplinary Research Center). In addition, the Senate Committee for Energy Management & Sustainability actively promotes communication and awareness-raising on aspects of sustainable development, enhances the commitment to sustainable practices, manages emerging system challenges and empowers novel approaches to a sustainable future through education, research, social engagement and operations.

KTU	NBS EduWORLD			The overall objective of NBS EduWORLD is to nurture a Nature-based Solution literate society, supporting a just transition to a sustainable future. For this, NBS EduWORLD will create an NBS community that facilitates synergies between NBS professionals and education providers and ensures free and easy access to NBS knowledge and resources for all.   To achieve this goal, NBS EduWORLD will summarise the state of play of NBS education in Europe and evaluate the initiatives already in place, determine how to expand and replicate them and establish a basis and framework for the project itself and future initiatives, resulting in guidance and (policy) recommendations. In parallel, the project will analyse NBS demonstrators, with an educational dimension (Tier-1), across Europe (NBS EduSystems), to support the testing and improvement of approaches and resources with NBS demonstrators with no or a limited educational dimension (Tier-2) and create the means and opportunities for all NBS practitioners to engage with educators, inter alia via Tier-3 NBS EduSystems. This will be done whilst supporting the overarching goal of promoting NBS as a viable career prospect for European citizens of all ages.   To adequately engage educators who are at different points on their NBS journey, the project will provide specific activities for those who are not yet familiar with the concept and benefits of NBS, and those already aware but in need of support to progress to the next stage. These activities will be scaled up/out by extensive dissemination and communication activities to maximise the project’s outreach and ensure its long-term success. Only by joining with NBS experts, education experts, civil society and supportive policies can we create a NBS EduWORLD - a community that makes a difference. 		https://nbseduworld.eu/	online materials, summer school 	A list of over 200 resources for NBS education and initiatives: [NBS EduWORLD | Resources for NBS Education](https://nbseduworld.eu/resources)	Students of all levels of education, including formal and non-formal, as well as educators.

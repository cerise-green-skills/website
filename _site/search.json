    "text": "Sustainable Development is typically defined as the intersection of three fields – environmental protection, social welfare and economic development – and can be best interpreted in a long-term perspective. Investing in sound energy management and sustainable development practices equals investing in the future, and constitutes an effective business strategy in view of expected energy and water cost savings, increased productivity, and related business resilience. Following the initiatives of NTUA’s Rector A. Boudouvis and Vice Rector I. Chatjigeorgiou, also Chair of the Senate Committee for Energy Management and Sustainable Development, a Roadmap to Energy Management and Sustainable Development has been compiled to promote sound energy management and sustainability practices as well as to align the efforts of the numerous respective groups and stakeholders across NTUA campuses.\nBy means of NTUA’s Roadmap to Energy Management and Sustainable Development, the Senate Committee for Energy Management and Sustainable Development develops strategies to promote sustainable practices on campus and aims at correlating the three pillars in the Roadmap: Environmental Protection, Education & Research, Community & Culture.\nThe Committee has compiled NTUA’s Roadmap to Energy Management and Sustainable Development to effectively correlate the roadmap to the goals established in NTUA’s strategic plan while incorporating proposals and suggestions of multiple university clusters including the student, faculty and staff communities. In effect, the Committee has identified five impact areas for each of the Roadmap pillars.\n\n\n\nnan\n\n\n\nNational Technical University of Athens (NTUA)\n\n\n\nNTUA’s Senate Committee for Energy Management & Sustainability has undertaken a vital role in meeting specific needs for energy management and sustainable design for both the built and the natural environment of the campuses of the National Technical University of Athens (Patission Complex, Zografou Campus, Lavrion Technological and Cultural Park, Metsovion Interdisciplinary Research Center).

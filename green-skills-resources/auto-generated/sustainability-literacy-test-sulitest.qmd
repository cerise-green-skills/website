description: "Sustainability Literacy Test (Sulitest) was created in France after\
  \ the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Cop21) and designed\
  \ to contribute to the Sustainable Development Goals. Sulitest is designed as an\
  \ initial platform to foster the mission to, \u201Csupport expanded sustainability\
  \ knowledge, skills and mindset that motivate individuals to become deeply committed\
  \ to building a sustainable future and to making informed and effective decisions\u201D\
  . The Sulitest initiative benefits from the support of a wide range of United Nations\
  \ entities, renowned national and international academic institutions, and the trust\
  \ of hundreds of contributors around the world. Sulitest was recognized in 2016\
  \ as one of the first featured initiatives of the UN Partnerships for Sustainable\
  \ Development Goals, and in 2017 as a contributor to the review of the 2030 Agenda\
  \ through the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development."

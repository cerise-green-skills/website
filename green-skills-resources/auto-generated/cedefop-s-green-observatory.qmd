description: "Cedefop Green Observatory (Cedefop GO) includes Cedefop\u2019s work\
  \ on the implications of the green transition on jobs and skills across sectors\
  \ and occupations in the EU. To make the transition happen, young learners, workers\
  \ and all citizens need to be equipped with green transition skills, knowledge and\
  \ understanding.  Vocational education and training (VET) has a crucial role to\
  \ play in supporting transitions in the short-term, as well as in reaching a new\
  \ sustainability paradigm in the longer run."

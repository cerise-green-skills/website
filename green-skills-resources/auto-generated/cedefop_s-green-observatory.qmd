## CEDEFOP's Green Observatory
### Description

Cedefop Green Observatory (Cedefop GO) includes CedefopÂ’s work on the implications of the green transition on jobs and skills across sectors and occupations in the EU. To make the transition happen, young learners, workers and all citizens need to be equipped with green transition skills, knowledge and understanding.  Vocational education and training (VET) has a crucial role to play in supporting transitions in the short-term, as well as in reaching a new sustainability paradigm in the longer run.

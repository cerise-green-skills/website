## Edinburgh Earth Initiative
### Description

The Edinburgh Earth Initiative is accelerating the University of Edinburghâs response to the climate crisis. Working with our academics, students, staff, and partners, we help ensure the University of Edinburgh is at the leading edge of climate research, teaching, innovation and action.
We drive resources towards core research on ecosystems, energy futures, and health; we create opportunities to train future leaders through scholarships and fellowships; we help to foster innovations that deliver real-world impacts on climate mitigation and adaptation; we help ensure that climate and environmental is central to our international partnerships; we work to make academic knowledge available to decision makers in business, industry, policymaking institutions, regulatory authorities, and civil society organisations; and we put climate justice at the centre of our institutional commitments.

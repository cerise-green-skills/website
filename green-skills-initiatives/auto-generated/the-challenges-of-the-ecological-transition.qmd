description: "This book provides a cross-sectional view of the global environmental\
  \ changes affecting our finite planet. In particular, it aims to provide an understanding\
  \ of the mechanisms and consequences of global warming and the erosion of biodiversity,\
  \ and how these relate to our lifestyles and consumption patterns.\nIt is based\
  \ on one of the first large-scale digital courses on the \u2018Challenges of the\
  \ ecological transition\u2019, which was taught in 2020 to several thousand undergraduate\
  \ students from all disciplines at the University of Paris-Saclay.\nTo meet the\
  \ book's cross-disciplinary objective, more than forty teacher-researchers and researchers\
  \ from different backgrounds have contributed, combining knowledge from the natural\
  \ sciences, the humanities and social sciences, law, economics, management, agronomy\
  \ and medicine."
funded_by: "This work benefited from financial support from the program\n\u201CInvestissement\
  \ d'Avenir\u201D."

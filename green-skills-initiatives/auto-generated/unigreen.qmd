### content

Specific agreements among these institutions facilitate the implementation of mobility actions. A significant outcome combining teaching and innovative, high-level research is the launch of a joint PhD program in Agro-Food Sciences, Technologies, and Biotechnologies starting from the academic year 2024-2025. This PhD program will award the degree from five universities (University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, AlmerÃ­a, Coimbra, Plovdiv, and Iceland). Additionally, joint programs for awarding dual or multiple degrees are being planned, which will further open up international opportunities through first and second-level educational paths. These programs will include lectures and seminars in shared virtual classrooms among the Alliance universities, participation in Summer Schools, Blended Intensive Programs (BIPs), and other educational activities that will occur both in-person and remotely in a lifelong learning context.
